`CHANGELOG.md` is one of the most important files in a repository. It allows others to find out about 
the most important changes in the project in short time.
To achieve this, `CHANGELOG.md` should be created be in accordance with the rules, however there is no one
standard agreed by community.

aa

Another big problem with `CHANGELOG.md` is a problem with merge conflicts. Probably you, as a developer, also encounter
it when someone merged changes to `CHANGELOG.md` before you.

When you create new merge/pull request and in the meantime you will release version, with old-fashioned `CHANGELOG.md`
you have to remember, to move new changelog's entry up, to the new version section. With this tool you don't have to!

If your PO is against you to use this tool in your projects, don't worry... just ask him to do `CHANGELOG.md` by his
own, and he will be the first one, who will ask you to use this tool. ðŸ”¥

**To solve these problems, this project was created. It allows to keep a changelog style and reduce merge request
conflicts by keeping every change in a separate YAML file and generate `CHANGELOG.md` during release.**

This tool is also helpful to create reliable release notes during your release process. 

### Reference

The convention is maintained according to the principles set out in the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and with some additions as a result from experience in developing various types of projects.

The same problem with merge conflicts with `CHANGELOG.md` was described by GitLab. [LINK](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/07/03/solving-gitlabs-changelog-conflict-crisis/)

### Examples
[TODO]
The example project with this plugin usage you can find in `example` directory.

## Usage
### Maven Plugin
### Starting
You can choose between two options:

1. Add a plugin to your `pom.xml`. For multi-module projects with one `CHANGELOG.md` add it in main `pom.xml`.

```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>dev.logchange</groupId>
                <artifactId>logchange-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.0.0</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

2. You don't have to add anything to your `pom.xml`, just use all commands with `groupId` and full plugin name, like
   here:
```shell
mvn dev.logchange:logchange-maven-plugin:init
```

After choosing one of the options, you can start using plugin as follows. Use this command from your terminal to create
important directories and empty CHANGELOG.md
```shell
mvn logchange:init
```

If you already had a `CHANGELOG.md` file you can move it to `changelog/archive.md` file. The name of the archive file have to start from `archive` phrase (f.e. `archive-1.0.0.md`).

After using `init` command or just creating `changelog/unreleased` directory your project is ready, and you can start
adding new changelog entries by creating YAML files.

**IMPORTANT:** If you develop on two main branches like f.e 1.1.X and 1.2.X **do not** merge 1.1.X branch to 1.2.X
before release otherwise YAML files will merge in one big version.
_In future there is a plan to support `unreleased*` directories names like `unreleased-1.1`_

### Adding new change

Adding new change is really simple, you can just add new YAML file to `changelog/unreleased` directory and keep format
presented below. 

You can also use command to generate this file, this one will guide you through whole process:

```shell
mvn logchange:add
```

[TODO] In other hand, if you would like to just generate an empty file, with some default strings, you can use:
```shell
mvn logchange:add -Dempty
```


### YAML format

```yml
title: Test title
authors:
  - nick: marwin1991
    url: https://github.com/marwin1991
merge_requests: 
  - 1
issues:
  - 1
links: # links to external systems, like jira or redmine
  - name: TASK_NUMBER
    url: https://www.google.pl
type: fixed # [added/changed/deprecated/removed/fixed/security]
important_notes:
  - Update style.css on server during instalation 1
configurations: # information about changes in available application configuration
  - type: database parameter
    action: add # [add/update/delete]
    key: simpleparam.name.enabled
    default_value: true
    description: Enables displying feature name
    more_info: "You can put more information here, any text f.e !1 #1, even [link test](https://google.com)" #if you want to use # sign, yaml value must be a string inside ""
```

| Keyword  | Description |
| :------------: | ------------- |
| `title`  | Description of change that has been made.  |
| `authors`  | List of change's authors.  |
| `merge_requests`  | The merge requests' numbers which are adding this change.  |
| `issues` | List of issues associated with this change. |
| `type` | Type of the change. |
| `links` | Any link to other project or external tool witch contains information about this change. |
| `important_notes` | Important notes, that has to be included in release. |
| `configurations` | Configurations changes important during release. |

### Generating `CHANGELOG.md`

Everytime you want to generate `CHANGELOG.md` you can use command:

```shell
mvn logchange:generate
```

To prevent merge conflicts (it is idea of this project) generation should be done with use of CI/CD Tool on a main
branch of a project.

[TODO]
Create Docker image with this tool, that will be use in CI/CD Tool, so that not only java projects will be able to use
it.

### Creating release (from unreleased)

```shell
mvn logchange:release
```

### `CHANGELOG.md` structure overview

TODO

### Versions summaries

TODO

### Releasing the version

TODO

### Archives

TODO

## TODO:

- add command to create archive-X.md from selected directory
- add tests
- add javadocs
- support  `unreleased*` directories names like `unreleased-1.1`

## Development

1. Java installed.
2. `mvn` as a command in your terminal(needed for integration tests).
